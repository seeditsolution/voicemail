lib/
db.js
The Voicemail Data Access Layer module is exported in this file. When called with a database configuration object and all required dependencies, an object keyed by repository name is returned given the connection string found in the database configuration object. The object is cached using the connection string so that asking for repositories for a given connection string more than once will yield the same object. The object returned by calling the module export with a database config contains the following keys:

context
mailbox
folder
message
contextConfig
mailboxConfig
helpers/
common.js
This file contains methods used by all repositories. These methods allow an abstract, repository independent, way of interacting with the tables that make up the data access layer. These methods rely on an instance of a provider as well as a node-sql representation of the table to be operated on to collect required meta-data. The following methods are exposed:

optionalArgument (returns the first argument to contain an expected argument type - helper method for optional arguments)
populateFields (given fields retrieve from a database, attaches the fields to the instance if the instance defines those fields)
createTable (creates a table using the node-sql table definition)
createIndex (creates a index using the given definitions)
get (returns a single object instance using a given where clause)
find (Returns a sequence of objects for a given query)
count (Returns the row count for a given query)
save (writes a row to the database using a given instance)
remove (removes a row from the database using a given instance)
This helper module is also responsible for converting data from the database to object instances and back. The following methods are used for this purpose:

instanceFromRow (converts a database row to an instance of a repository model)
getFields (determines which fields should be stored in the database given a repository model instance and a node-sql table definition as well as converts reference types to foreign keys)
providers/
postgres.js
This file contains PostgreSQL specific implementation details. The following methods are exposed:

runQuery
Runs a single query wrapped in a transaction.

beginTransaction
Begins a transaction and returns an object that can be used to progress through the transaction. The object contains the following methods:

runQuery
commit
rollback
forUpdate
Adds 'for update' to the query text to enable row locking.

autoIncrement
Converts primary key query text to be of type serial to enable auto incrementing IDs.

convertDataFromStorage
Converts the date that was stored without a time zone to a moment instance in UTC format.

converDataForStorage
Leaves the date untouched. PostgreSQL will simply store the data without a time zone. We will later read it as a UTC formatted date.

getDateType
Returns the date type to be used for PostgreSQL. In this case we are using a timestamp without a time zone.

sqlite.js
This file contains sqlite specific implementation details. The following methods are exposed:

runQuery
Runs a single query wrapped in a transaction.

beginTransaction
Begins a transaction and returns an object that can be used to progress through the transaction. Since sqlite does not support row level locking, a BEGIN IMMEDIATE statement is used to begin a transaction level lock immediately instead of using deferred locking. The object contains the following methods:

runQuery
commit
rollback
forUpdate
Returns the query as is since sqlite does not use row level locking.

autoIncrement
Returns the create statement as is since sqlite will automatically auto increment integer primary keys.

convertDataFromStorage
Reads the date as a unix timestamp and converts it to a moment instance in UTC format.

converDataForStorage
Converts the date to a unix timestamp using moment.

getDateType
Returns the date type to be used for sqlite. In this case we are using an integer since we will be storing dates as unix timestamps.

This method will increment the unread count for the given mailbox.

readMessage
Updates the read/unread count of the given mailbox using the given read status mwi updater method. This uses the provider specific beginTransaction and the methods it exposes to atomically update the read/unread count on the mailbox and update MWI counts via ARI using the provided mwi updater method. This method will increment the read count and decrement the unread count for the given mailbox.

deletedMessage
Updates the read/unread count of the given mailbox using the given mwi updater method. This uses the provider specific beginTransaction and the methods it exposes to atomically update the read/unread count on the mailbox and update MWI counts via ARI using the provided mwi updater method. If the message was read, this method will decrement the read count for the given mailbox. If the message was not read, it will decrement the unread count instead.

markAsRead
Marks the message as read in the database. This uses the provider specific beginTransaction and the methods it exposes to atomically fetch the given message to ensure it as not been marked as read already. Once this has been done, a boolean flag is returned to indicate whether or not the message was updated. This can then be used to update the mailbox MWI counts using the mailbox repository.
